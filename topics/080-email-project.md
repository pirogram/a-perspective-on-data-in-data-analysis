title: Email Dataset Project

  The goal of this project is to further practice what we have studied so far. This project has 3 parts:
  * Given a real world environment, identify the variables about which you could make observation.
  * Provide your point of view on how you would classify the variables as identifiers or measured.
  * Identifying the scale of measurement for different variables.

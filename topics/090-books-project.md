title: Books Dataset Project
--- |

  The goal of this project is to further practice what we have studied so far. This project has 3 parts:
  * Given a real world environment, identify the variables about which you could make observation.
  * Provide your point of view on how you would classify the variables as identifiers or measured.
  * Identifying the scale of measurement for different variables.

  Let's say, you would like to make observations about the books listing from [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com). Open the [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com) website. Looking at the information available for each book on a book page ([example](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15881.Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets)), identify a list of at least 10 variables that could be part of your dataset and list them here.

  For each variable that you identified, discuss the scale of measurement. If there are variables where scale is not applicable, mention so.
